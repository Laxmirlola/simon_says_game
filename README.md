# Simon Says Game ðŸ§©

Welcome to the **Simon Says Game**, a fun and interactive memory game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Test your memory skills as you follow an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. Keep playing to achieve your highest score!

## Features

- **Beautiful Design**: A visually appealing interface with smooth animations.
- **Score Tracking**: View your current score as you play.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## How to Play

1. Start the game by clicking the **Start** button.
2. Watch the sequence of colors as they flash in order.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the color buttons in the same order.
4. If you get the sequence right, your score increases, and a longer sequence is played.
5. The game ends when you make a mistake. Try again to beat your high score!

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game interface.
  - Custom animations for button flashes and transitions.
  - A modern, user-friendly design.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for game functionality.
  - Handles sequence generation, user interaction, and score tracking.

## File Structure
